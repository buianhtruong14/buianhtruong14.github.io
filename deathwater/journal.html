								<p class="post-title">Water is being destroyed and dying over time by humans</p>
								<p class="post-text">Today, our rivers, streams, reservoirs, lakes and the sea are
                                     gradually polluted with chemicals, waste, plastics and lots of other pollutants. 
                                     This is the reason why water sources are seriously polluted, negatively affecting 
                                     human health as well as animals and plants due to water pollution. </p>
                                <p class="post-text">Water pollution is quite common in Vietnam and negatively affects 
                                    the health of the people. Water is indirectly killing more people every year and 
                                    is on the rise with time. In Vietnam, the natural water source to drink and not 
                                    harm the body is almost zero. If we don't take action, our clean water will be used 
                                    in the future. quite a lot now but we need to dig deeper first.</p>
                                <p class="post-text">Firstly, the management of imported waste still has many loopholes. 
                                    According to the General Department of Customs, as of August 28, 2018, the whole country 
                                    had up to 17,000 containers of scrap without clearance, mainly at some seaports. These 
                                    wastes are mainly plastic, paper, iron and aluminum scrap brought by foreign shipping 
                                    lines. In urban areas and many provinces, landfills are not treated due to landfills 
                                    and overburden disposal. The amount of solid waste such as plastic, plastic bags, ... 
                                    is increasing and dumping into the sea and river, causing serious pollution in some areas.</p>
                                <p class="post-text">The above mentioned serious environmental pollution are caused by objective 
                                    and subjective reasons, of which subjective is the main reason.</p>
                                <p class="post-text"> Regarding objective reasons: Our country is located in a geographical location
                                     greatly affected by climate change, leading to drought, flood and salinity in some areas. Budget 
                                     conditions are very difficult, so the investment in the environment is very limited. Rapid population 
                                     growth, urbanization and industrialization also contribute to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, 
                                     degradation, resource depletion and biodiversity loss ....</p>
                                 <p class="post-text">On subjective reasons: Awareness and awareness of environmental protection 
                                     responsibility of a large number of officials, public servants, civil servants and people on 
                                     vironmental protection have gradually changed. In particular, the sense of responsibility of 
                                     part of government officials at all levels and business owners is still limited. Some 
                                     officials governed by local interests violate environmental protection laws. The state 
                                     management, law enforcement and application of science and technology in environmental 
                                    protection in many places have not been paid enough attention.</p>
