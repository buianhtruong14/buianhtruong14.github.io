                                <p class="post-text">The common consequence of water pollution 
                                    is the increasing proportion of people with acute and chronic 
                                    diseases related to water pollution such as conjunctivitis, 
                                    diarrhea, and cancer. People living in polluted areas are becoming 
                                    increasingly infected with suspected diseases due to the use of dirty 
                                    water in all activities. In addition, water pollution also causes great 
                                    losses for production and business sectors and aquaculture households.</p>
                        
								<p class="post-text">Ponds, lakes and rivers in Vietnam are seriously polluted, 
                                    and people in these areas do not have enough clean water for daily use as 
                                    well as for irrigation activities. It greatly affects the living conditions 
                                    of people.</p>
                                <p class="post-text">When using polluted water, there will be many pathogens. 
                                    The most serious consequences of this condition are the increasing number 
                                    of people suffering from conjunctivitis, cancer, diarrhea, and the number 
                                    of deaths especially among children in polluted water sources. . .</p>
                                <p class="post-text">Scientific studies also show that when people use arsenic-contaminated 
                                    water to eat and drink, people can get cancer of which the most common is skin cancer. 
                                    In addition, arsenic also toxic to the circulatory system when drinking water with 
                                    arsenic content of 0.1 mg / l. Therefore, it is necessary to treat arsenic-contaminated 
                                    water before use for living and eating.</p>
                                <p class="post-text">People who have been infected with lead for a long time may develop kidney 
                                    disease, neuropathy, ammonium, nitrate and nitrite infections, cause blue skin, anemia and 
                                    can cause cancer. Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) is a common additive in petroleum that can 
                                    cause cancer. Sodium infection (Na) causes high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, 
                                    sulfur in gastrointestinal diseases, Potassium and Cadimi cause degenerative disease of the 
                                    spine and back pain. Organic compounds, pesticides, pesticides, herbicides, growth stimulants, 
                                    food preservatives, phosphorus ... etc cause poisoning, hepatitis, vomiting and some serious

                                <p class="post-text1"> Prolonged exposure will cause serious cancer to the 
                                    internal organs. Bleach Xenon peroxide, sodium percarbonate cause respiratory 
                                    inflammation, oxalate combines with calcium to create calcium oxalate causing
