                                <p class="post-text">Faced with these requirements, measures must 
                                    be taken to protect water resources - to protect our own future.</p>
                                <strong class="post-title2">Improve the sense of responsibility of the community</strong> <br>
								<p class="post-text">This is the most important measure. If each of us raises our sense of 
                                    responsibility for water conservation, we will build a good community. Perhaps 
                                    from the most trivial things such as: do not throw waste indiscriminately, do not 
                                    discharge waste, toxins directly into the environment, in the process of using pesticides, 
                                    plant protection products Need to use according to instructions , do not throw 
                                    indiscriminately into the environment, especially the water environment. </p>
                                
                                <strong class="post-title2">Save water</strong> <br>
                                <p class="post-text">While clean water is increasingly polluted, our mission is to save water. 
                                    In the process of using daily water such as eating, bathing, cleaning activities ... 
                                    using enough water, turning off the faucet when not in use, limiting washing food directly 
                                    under the tap ...</p>
                                <strong class="post-title2">Waste treatment before being discharged into the environment</strong> <br>
                                <p class="post-text">Waste treatment before being discharged into the environment</p>
                                
                                <p class="post-text">Daily-life wastes, agricultural and industrial wastes, before being discharged 
                                    into the environment, must be properly and appropriately treated. Waste classification is a 
                                    necessary activity. Or it is necessary to build wastewater treatment systems in industrial areas, 
                                    and strictly treat according to regulations before being discharged into the environment.</p>
                                <p class="post-text">In addition to the above measures, many families now use water filters to 
                                    protect their own health. This is the safest and easiest way to take it for all families. </p>
                                <p class="post-text"> Water filters help provide clean water for drinking, living, ensuring the 
                                    best quality water supply. Depending on the needs, you can choose a water filter that is 
                                    compatible with the needs of each family. </p>
                                <p class="post-text1">To serve the general purpose of the whole family, the total domestic water 
                                    filter can be used. If only used for dining, cooking, you should use a household water filter. 
                                    If only purely for bathing purposes. </p>
