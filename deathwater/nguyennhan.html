                                <p class="post-title">The cause of water pollution</p>
                                <p class="post-text">There are many causes of water pollution. In this article, 
                                    I will divide the causes of pollution into natural and artificial causes.</p>
                                <strong class="post-title2">Natural pollution</strong> <br>
								<p class="post-text">Natural pollution comes from melting snow, rain, floods, storms ... 
                                    It can also come from living activities of living things, including corpses. When 
                                    plants and organisms die, their bodies will be decomposed by microorganisms into 
                                    organic matter. Part of the organic matter will soak into the ground and groundwater. 
                                    This causes groundwater pollution and gradually infiltrates into rivers, lakes, 
                                    streams, and the sea. </p>
                                <p class="post-text">Flooding can make the water no longer clean. In addition, floods also 
                                    carry away the waste where people dump garbage. Floodwaters can also be polluted by 
                                    agrochemicals, waste areas, etc.</p>
                                <p class="post-text">Natural pollution is rare, but quite serious. Natural pollution is not 
                                    a cause of water quality degradation.</p>
                                <p class="post-text">Domestic wastewater: is wastewater generated from households, hospitals, 
                                    hotels, school offices, containing wastes in the daily life and sanitation process of people. 
                                    The basic components of domestic wastewater are biodegradable organic substances 
                                    (carbohydrates, proteins, oils), nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen), solids and bacteria. 
                                    Depending on living standards and lifestyles, the amount of wastewater as well as the amount 
                                    of substances in the wastewater of each person in a day are different. In general, the higher 
                                    the living standard, the higher the discharge and the discharge load.</p>

                                <p class="post-text1">Daily-life waste water: is waste water generated from households, hospitals, 
                                    hotels, school agencies, containing wastes in human daily life and sanitation. The basic

                                    industrial production, small scale industry and transportation facilities. Unlike domestic 
                                    or municipal wastewater, industrial wastewater does not have the same basic composition, 
                                    but depends on the specific industry. For example, wastewater from food processing enterprises 
                                    often contains large amounts of organic matter; wastewater of tanning factories in addition to 
                                    organic substances also has heavy metals, sulfides, ... People often use the quantity of PE 
                                    (Population Equivalent) to compare relatively the level of pollution of Industrial wastewater 
                                    with municipal wastewater. This quantity is determined based on the average emissions per person 
                                    per day for a given pollutant. The main pollutants commonly used for comparison are COD, BOD5, 
                                    and SS. In addition to the main sources of pollution as above, there are other sources of water 
                                    pollution such as from health or from agriculture, forestry and fishery activities of man ...</p>
